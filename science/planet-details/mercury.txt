Mercury is the first planet from Sun. Its eccentric orbit takes the small planet as close as 47 million km and as far as 70 million km from the sun. If one could stand on the scorching surface of Mercury when it is at its closest point to the sun, the sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth.

Mercury is named after the Roman messenger god Mercury because it is the fastest planet as it moves around the Sun.<br><br><br>
