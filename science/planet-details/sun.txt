The sun at the heart of our solar system is a yellow dwarf star, a hot ball of glowing gases. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris in its orbit. Electric currents in the sun generate a magnetic field that is carried out through the solar system by the solar wind.

The connection and interactions between the sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and aurorae.<br>
Solis is Latin for sun. Sol is the Roman equivalent of the Greek sun god Helios.<br><br><br>
